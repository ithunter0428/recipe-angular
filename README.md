This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.2.

## Quick start

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

    It will add 4 images and 2 recipes to your Flotiq account.

    Run `ng run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

    If you wish to add new elements to the project run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

    Run `npm run build:prod` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

    To build the static version with Scully run:

    ```sh
    npm run build --prod
    npm run scully -- --scanRoutes
    npm run scully serve
    ```

    This will start the Scully static server on `http://localhost:1668/`
